You can choose either **Faucet Service** or **Self-hosted** options:

## Faucet Service

### Why Faucet Service?

- **High Concurrency**: Capable of handling high concurrent requests.
- **Robot Prevention**: Only browser users are allowed to claim.
- **No Deployment Needed**: Simply requires a REST endpoint and basic configuration.
- **Explorer Integration**: Native integration with the `Ping Dashboard` on [testnet.ping.pub](https://testnet.ping.pub).
- **Customized Claiming Rules**: Limited by IP address and wallet address.

### Prepare for Faucet Service

- **Submit Chain Configuration**: You can submit your chain configuration [here](https://github.com/ping-pub/ping.pub).
- **Fund the Faucet**: Find the faucet address on your faucet page and send some tokens to it.

## Self-hosted

- [Cosmos](https://github.com/ping-pub/faucet/tree/cosmos): Supports simple Cosmos-based blockchains.
- [Evmos](https://github.com/ping-pub/faucet/tree/evmos): Supports Evmos-like blockchains.
